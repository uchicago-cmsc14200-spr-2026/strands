Abstract base classes for Strands game.

There are four ABCs:
- PosBase, which represents positions,
- StrandBase, which represents individual strands,
- BoardBase, which represents boards for the game, and
- StrandsGameBase, which represents the game logic.

Throughout the implementation, PosBase values consist
of 0-indexed Row and Col values.
